Usage

* IMPORTANT:
  * Setup MFA with mobile app as instructed [here](https://docs.copado.com/resources/Storage/copado-robotic-testing-publication/CRT%20Site/qwords-reference/current/qwords/_attachments/QForce.html#mfa-setup)
  * OR contact CRT support for ip's which can be whitelisted.
* Add your Salesforce instance url to CRT variable "login_url"
* Add your Salesforce user to CRT variable "username"
* Add your Salesforce user password to CRT variable "password"
* If using MFA setup, add variable "secret" with your MFA token to CRT variables
  * Note: it's best to encrypt/hide sensitive information (password)

Variables can be added by hovering on top of your test suite, selecting
"Suite details" icon and adding them using "+Variable" button.

Use these automated test cases as a basis to learn and start modifying
them to suit your specific needs.
